# KalmanPendulum
Kalman Filter on a 1D pendulum problem

1) Comparing direct integration with linear kalman, EKF and UKF.
Kalman filters were completely implemented in simulink - no MATLAB scripts or workspace variables running in the background.
As such, this repo should be a quick way to learn the implemetnation.

2) s-fcns for introducing MATLAB visuals into the simulation are also implemented.

3)  The .doc file explains the problem well, but the numbers are not updated to what is simulated.
